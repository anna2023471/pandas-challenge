    "The present analysis looked at academic performance within and between schools within one geographical area. Average scores and passing rates in maths and reading were analysed, and overall school performance was measured based on the proportion of students passing both subjects. Schools were compared against each other based on overall passing rates as well as average scores across acacemic years. Overall student performance was also analysed based on a school's size and type classification, and its spending per student.\n",

    "The results of the analysis show that school size has the largest impact on overall student performance, with small schools outperforming large schools by 9 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spending appears to be negatively correlated with overall student performance, with lower-spending schools outperforming higher-spending schools. The lowest spending schools outperform the highest spending schools by almost 10 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "There does not appear to be any significant difference in average performance between government and independent schools. However, government shools are overrepresented in the bottom five.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-school performance is reasonably consistent across academic years, suggesting that level of study is not a significant factor in a school's performance."
