Submission contains:

Final_report.ipynb in PyCity Schools folder

schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv in Resources folder

The code df.index.name=None was provided by Kat from AskBCS

The code df.set_index(df.columns[0]) came from StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36606931/how-to-set-in-pandas-the-first-column-and-row-as-index

Tutor Simon Rennocks helped me with the code for size_summary as my original code was getting a warning.
